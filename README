Javascript interactive factor square puzzle. 
You are presented with a blank puzzle, with
none of its clues or answers displayed. You can right-click on
a cell to display its clue, left-click to enter numbers when you know what they
are. As you see more and more clues
you can infer more of the answers. The idea is to complete
the puzzle using the fewest clues.
The number above the puzzle is your score. It goes down when you use
clues, or when you enter a wrong number, and up when you enter a correct number.
The three numbers below the puzzle are, from left to right, the numbers of 
clues used, wrong numbers entered, and correct answers entered.
The score starts at 16, and clues cost 2 points each, so if you start by asking for
all 8 possible clues (on the outside, i.e. the products of the rows, columns,
and diagonals), you will start with a score of 0. Correct answers are worth
2 points. Wrong answers cost 1 point, but after you have entered the correct answer
in a square, if you then enter a wrong answer in the same square, it costs 4 points.
